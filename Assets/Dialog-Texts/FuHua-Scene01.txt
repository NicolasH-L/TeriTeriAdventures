Hey Teri!
You barely survived the plane crash!

Are you okay? Try to move your body with "A" and "D" on your keyboard to see if you're fine.

Alternatively, you can try pressing on your spacebar to jump.

Awesome!, looks like you're fine!. My name is FuHua and I'm here to guide you.

See that sign over there? That's your weapon, you can pick it up by walking up to the sign.

After getting the weapon, try to attack by pressing "J" on your keyboard.

Nice!, you're good to go! But first, let me tell you something....

You need to escape this island as soon as possible. You must pass through this beach first.

Then you must navigate through the forest and find the bunker
But! Beware of whats behind the bunker. Powerful creates lurk in there and at the of the bunker you will find the Gatekeeper.

Once you defeat the Gatekeeper you will be fre from this island.
I wish you good luck and have faith in yourself!!
