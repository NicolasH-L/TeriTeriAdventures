Hey!
I'm glad you made it this far.

Great... Great! Don't give up! We're about to get out of this island!
Here you'll find many Honkai beasts roaming around. 

They are very agressive and deal a lot of damage, so don't stick around them for too long.

Also, I spotted some scary looking Honkai Laser Traps, I wouldn't try to get too close to them if I were you.

Oh you don't know what Honkai beasts are!?
They are the result of a powerful being that used its power to transform any living creatures into those monsters!

Who's this powerful being you ask? 
Well, it's the Gatekeeper Kiana, she's is the one responsible for this island mess and the reason why we are unable to leave.

Oh and ugh... Apparently she can create portals that shoots homing cookies, so that's pretty interesting... Anyways, don't get hit by the
cookies.

What should you do, you ask? Well, just make sure to avoid her cookies and defeat her with your weapon.

I wish you good luck in your endeavors. And please get us out of her safely.
