Hey!... Yeah you!
My name is Otto, and I've been stuck on this island for a long time now... 

You don't look weak and I could use your help to get us out of this Island.

If you don't mind lending your help, I'll share some information I gathered from my research.

I'm just a scientist that was sent here to do some research on the local wildlife and I've encountered them by coincidence.
You see... They are not human like us, they can shoot weird green energy orbs and speak in a foreign language. 

These people or... should I say these Island Savage Natives have been living inside this longhouse-like structure.

They love to set TRAPS inside their house to catch preys, so... 

Anyways! You should be careful while looking for a way out... 

Oh! and try to stay alive and get us of both out of here safely please. Oh! and ugh these "people", don't look like they are very fond of Humans so be extra careful.
